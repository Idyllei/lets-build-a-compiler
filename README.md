Let's Build a Compiler
----------------------

This is my workthrough of [Let's Build a
Compiler](http://www.compilers.iecc.com/crenshaw/), though I'm using Rust, not
Pascal, and targeting x86.

I'm going to try and keep the commit history linear, with the commit message
being the part/section I'm on. This way, you too can follow the series!
